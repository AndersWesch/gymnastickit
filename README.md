# Framework #

This is my own framework made for copying to quickly setup a PHP MVC Project.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy project
* Run: `composer serve` or `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public/`
* Build application on top

### Things it needs ###
* Models/User.php CRUD
* Logger that logs to a file
* System/Session.php to handle $_session related things
